# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-using-Machine-Learning
This repo is an implementation of [COLOR CHANNEL FUSION NETWORK FOR LOW-LIGHT IMAGE ENHANCEMENT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9506305/) publication
# Code
This folder contains scripts for Python class definitions of various components proposed in the publication, such as  Channel Correlation Network, Multiscale Fusion Network e.t.c
The Notebook.ipynb, combines all functions to implement the proposed architecture. It requires the scripts and dataset to be present in your Gdrive.
# Data
This folder contains image dataset, used in the publication i.e [SICE dataset] (https://github.com/csjcai/SICE).
